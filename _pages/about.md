Hello! I am a scientist interested in answering questions and discovering emergent phenomena at the intersection of physics, chemistry and molecular biology. I build tools that use physics and AI to understand the molecular world. These tools are advancing the frontiers of drug discovery and biomedicine.

I started my career as a high school physics and chemistry teacher in Baltimore, Maryland with [Teach For America](https://www.teachforamerica.org/). Teaching young people shaped how I see the role of science in the world. After teaching, I completed a Ph.D. in biophysics from Washington University in St. Louis, and then became a [Truman Fellow](https://www.sandia.gov/labnews/2019/09/26/truman-fellows/) at Sandia National Labs. After my fellowship, I worked for two years as a scientist and group leader at [Prescient Design](https://x.com/prescientdesign?lang=en), the AI research division of Genentech. I am now one of the founding members of [Achira](https://achira.ai/), a startup building foundation models for chemistry to transform drug discovery.


<!-- This experience shaped the way I see the world and science in a profound way.  -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
